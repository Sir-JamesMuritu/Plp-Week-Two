# Week Two Assignment - List Operations

This repository contains a simple Python script that demonstrates basic list operations, as required for the Week Two assignment.

## Objective

Practice manipulating Python lists by using built-in methods such as `append()`, `insert()`, `extend()`, `pop()`, `sort()`, and `index()`.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Create an empty list** called `my_list`.
2. **Append** the following elements: `10`, `20`, `30`, `40`.
3. **Insert** the value `15` at the second position.
4. **Extend** the list with another list: `[50, 60, 70]`.
5. **Remove** the last element from the list.
6. **Sort** the list in ascending order.
7. **Find and print** the index of the value `30`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `list_operations.py` file.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python list_operations.py
```

## Example Output

```
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
Index of value 30: 3
```
